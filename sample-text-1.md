PROTECTING TOMORROW FOR EVERYONE
In today’s world, ESG issues are of critical importance to business. We’re helping our clients transition to, and thrive in, a more sustainable future. We ask tough questions about purpose and transparency, and find the answers together.

We’re also looking for opportunities to integrate sustainability into our governance, decision-making and operations. We ensure our people have the right resources and support they need to perform and deliver at their best for our clients.

How we’re transforming our business
Our sustainability strategy is informed by our recent double materiality assessment. It’s focused on taking action in the areas most important to our business and that have the most influence on society and the environment. We’ve put them into five interrelated categories: our people, our clients, our society, our environment, and sound governance.

Reaching net zero by 2040
The climate crisis is already having a severe impact around the world. We must take decisive action now. Professional services is not a carbon intensive sector. We know the vast majority of our carbon footprint – 95% – is in our supply chain, including procurement and business travel. But we must do our part to decarbonise our business and value chain, and help our clients do the same. The net zero transition is our number one material issue.
Collaboration plays a crucial role in climate action. We're a founding member of the Legal Sustainability Alliance and the Net Zero Lawyers Alliance. JP Douglas-Henry, our Managing Director for Sustainability and Resilience, sits on NZLA's steering committee. NZLA is committed to climate action, promoting sustainability reporting and sharing best practice in the legal sector.
In 2023 we founded the Legal Charter 1.5 alongside seven other law firms with offices in the UK. This group seeks to galvanise the legal sector’s role in achieving the Paris goals.
We’re a founding member of the Legal Taskforce for the Sustainable Markets Initiative (SMI), a leading project to build a coordinated global effort to enable the private sector to accelerate the transition to a sustainable future.
We're also a founding member of Global Alliance of Impact Lawyers, a community of legal leaders using the practice of law to have a positive impact on people and the planet, and to accelerate the just transition.
We have a near-term target to halve our carbon footprint in all three scopes by 2030 against a 2019 baseline. We also have a net zero target to reduce all three scopes by 90% by 2040 from a 2019 baseline, and to neutralise the remaining residual emissions at the net zero target year, 2040, through carbon removal. Both of these targets follow the methodology of the Science-Based Targets initiative.

Decarbonising our business
To decarbonise our business, we’re focused on transforming it in five areas:
•	implementing our Thoughtful Travel campaign to reduce emissions by 75% by 2030
•	working with suppliers to reduce emissions on our supply chain by 25% by 2030
•	switching to renewable electricity across Europe by 2025, and all offices by 2030
•	optimising energy use in our offices
•	designing future workspaces with sustainability and health in mind
Our biggest potential contribution to global decarbonisation efforts is by helping clients on their own net zero journeys. We’re ensuring our approach to client work is aligned with our climate ambition, including how we map and measure advised emissions as we develop our climate transition plan. 
Our environmental actions are aligned with locally and internationally recognised standards and initiatives, including:
•	certification to ISO 14001, ISO 50001 and the Carbon Trust’s Route to Net Zero standard
•	the UN Global Compact
•	The Legal Renewables Initiative in the UK
•	Business Ambition for 1.5°C.

PURSUING JUSTICE AND SOCIAL CHANGE
Around the world, many people and communities face barriers to justice. Through our pro bono work, we help children, asylum seekers, refugees and other under-served groups get the legal support, access to justice and fair treatment they need and deserve. 
We also give free advice to nonprofits, UN agencies, intergovernmental organizations and social enterprises. This allows them to focus on their missions and key objectives. And we support social and economic development, sound legal institutions and women's advancement in under-resourced regions.

Building an inclusive culture
We’re all different, and those differences are our greatest strength. Everyone should feel valued for who they are. We take meaningful action to create an inclusive culture in our business, and make a positive difference to our communities. We’ve made progress, but there’s a lot more to do. The legal sector still isn’t diverse enough.
Firms that fail to take action to improve diversity aren’t just reinforcing social inequalities in the legal profession and wider society. They’re also putting at risk their innovation and competitiveness. Our materiality assessment ranked diversity, mobility and inclusion as our second-highest-rated issue.

CELEBRATING OUR DIVERSITY
Embracing diversity strengthens us and inclusivity enables everyone to thrive. But there’s more to do. So we’re listening, learning and taking meaningful action to make a positive difference in our business and our communities.
We’re amplifying the voices of our people and empowering them to fulfill their potential. We do this so we can build the best teams, help our clients succeed, and nurture a culture where everyone feels they belong.
